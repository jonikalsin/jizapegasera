The lyrics describe the feeling of being swept up in the rhythm and movement of the electric slide, a popular line dance from the 1970s that was often performed to the song. The repeated refrain of "it's electric" emphasizes the intangible and irresistible quality of electric music, which can only be felt by fully immersing oneself in its energy.</p><br><p>As the song progresses, the lyrics turn to focus on the experience of going to a party and sharing in the joy and excitement of dancing with others. The singer invites the listener to come along on a "party ride" and learn the electric slide, highlighting the communal aspect of dance and the way that music can bring people together. The final repetition of "ola ola eh, ola eh" adds a playful and celebratory touch, underscoring the carefree and joyful vibe of the song.</p><br><p>Overall, "Electric Boogie" is a catchy and uplifting anthem that celebrates the power of music and dance to fill us with energy and joy.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>It's electric!</u><br>The energy and excitement of this music is hard to put into words, but we'll try</p><br><p><u>You can't see it (it's electric!)</u><br>The spirit of this music can't be seen, but it's definitely there</p><br><p><u>You gotta feel it (it's electric!)</u><br>The only way to truly understand this music is to experience it in your body and soul</p><br><p><u>Ooh, it's shakin' (it's electric!)</u><br>The pulsating rhythm and beats of this music will get you moving and grooving</p><br><p><u>Jiggle-a-mesa-cara</u><br>We don't know what this means, but it sure sounds like a fun way to dance</p><br><p><u>She's a pumpin' like a matic</u><br>The music is so infectious that it's making everyone move like a machine</p><br><p><u>She's a movin' like electric</u><br>The music is causing people to move in a way that is both fluid and electric</p><br><p><u>She sure got the boogie</u><br>The person dancing is really feeling the music and letting loose with some serious boogie-ing</p><br><p><u>You gotta know it (It's electric Boogie woogie, woogie!)</u><br>Once you experience this music, you'll understand why it's referred to as electric boogie woogie</p><br><p><u>Now you can't hold it (It's electric Boogie woogie, woogie!)</u><br>The music is so entrancing that it's impossible to resist moving your body to the beat</p><br><p><u>But you know it there, Here, there and everywhere</u><br>This music is everywhere, and once it gets ahold of you, it's hard to escape its pull</p><br><p><u>I've got to move, I'm going on a party ride</u><br>The energy of this music is making me want to dance and party all night long</p><br><p><u>I've got to groove, groove, groove, And from this music I just can't hide</u><br>The music is so infectious that I can't help but dance and move with the groove</p><br><p><u>Are you comin' with me?

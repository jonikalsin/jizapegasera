Blending tough biker chic with boho vibes, she wore a skull-emblazoned tee shirt with black and white bell bottoms with another pair of legs printed on them. Her golden hair was down in long beachy waves which swept down to her hips and she popped a pair of sunglasses on over her tan face.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>At her side was Axl, who donned a baseball tee with “Welcome to the Jungle” written on the front. To complete the outfit, he added olive green joggers and hightop Nike sneakers. He looked like he was in play mode, seen carrying a small action figure during the trip.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Fergie and Axl have been enjoying plenty of bonding time lately.

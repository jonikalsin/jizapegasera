The actor’s death following a private battle with cancer was announced on Monday, July 31. He was 70 years old. Following his death, he posthumously released a statement. ‘Please accept my apology for not going public with what I’ve been facing the last six years. I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect for my friends, fans, and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you,’ he said.</p><p>Born in Peekskill, New York, Paul began working in television after completing school at the California Institute for the Arts. After a few appearances on programs like ‘The Gong Show,’ Paul joined the improv troupe The Groundlings, where he began to develop the character that would become Pee-wee Herman.</p><p>After a failed ‘Saturday Night Live’ audition, Paul began ‘The Pee-wee Herman Show’ as a live stage show. He became a mainstream star when HBO showed the performance in 1981. He began making many public appearances as Pee-wee, including in films like ‘Cheech And Chong’s Next Movie’ in 1981. The character proved so popular that it led to the movie ‘Pee-wee’s Big Adventure’ and TV show ‘Pee-wee’s Playhouse,’ which ran from 1986 until 1991.</p><p>Following a 1991 arrest, Paul avoided the public eye, but slowly began making appearances in other non-Pee-wee-related projects like ‘Murphy Brown’, ‘The Nightmare Before Christmas’, ’30 Rock’, and ‘Blow.’</p><p>In 2010, Paul starred in a new version of ‘The Pee-wee Herman Show,’ which ran on Broadway and was taped for HBO. In 2016, ‘Pee-Wee’s Big Holiday’ was released on Netflix. He continued to take on small acting and voice-acting roles in recent years.</p><p>Following the sad news of his death, scroll through our gallery to see photos of Paul over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZL2iwctmqZ6tkpq7tHnYqKynn12ltbDAzqxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

He was eighty-two when he died away on Wednesday.</p><p>Over the course of more than 15 years, King oversaw the university’s phenomenal enrollment increase as well as bold infrastructural and program expansions.</p><p>According to the university, King passed away at the Forrest General-Asbury Hospice Center with his family by his side and Mississippians from all across the state praying for him.</p><p>“Dr. King’s leadership elevated us to a new level and demonstrated an unwavering love for William Carey University.” WCU President Dr. Ben Burnett stated, “His lifetime of service in the field of education and with the Baptist churches of Mississippi changed the lives of Mississippians for generations.”</p><p>“His vision inspired all who were fortunate to work alongside him – and the impact he had on all of us is immeasurable. I count myself blessed to have worked directly under his leadership for the last 10 years of my career and I am humbled to follow in his footsteps as president of William Carey University.”</p><p>King, the first Carey alumnus to be chosen president, brought more than thirty years of expertise in public education from elementary school to tertiary education to the role.</p><p>He formerly held the positions of executive vice president, vice president for graduate and off-campus programs, professor of psychology, and dean of the School of Psychology and Counseling at WCU.</p><p>Following Hurricane Katrina, a brand-new 50-acre campus was built in Biloxi under his direction as president.</p><p>The campus in Hattiesburg expanded to 170 acres from 135 acres. The Doctor of Physical Therapy program started in the fall of 2016, the College of Osteopathic Medicine opened its doors in 2010, and the new College of Health Sciences Building is scheduled to open in July 2021.</p><p>In 2018, the School of Pharmacy at the Tradition campus opened for enrollment. The same year, Scianna Hall, an academic building with a spacious community gathering area, was dedicated by WCU.</p><p>Six sports teams became eighteen, and the university added additional degrees and hybrid/online courses. Moreover, enrollment more than doubled under King’s leadership.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkaq0qq3OrKZyZZKZe6aw1Getp2eUp3q1u8ymsGajmaO0brvBoquumaKueqe70aacq2WnmMJuvNGeqqKclaPBbrzArKqeq12WxKLFjJqrZpmXmnp5fo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

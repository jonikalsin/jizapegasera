Help me! Please, help me,” she yells.</p><p>The young man kept his grip on the bike’s handlebars and repeatedly told the woman that he already paid to use that particular bike and it wasn’t hers.&nbsp;</p><p>“Get off me! Get off me, you’re hurting my fetus,” the woman then shouted as she pushed the man away.</p><p>“I’m not touching you! You’re putting your stomach on my hand,” the man replied.</p><p>Halfway through the clip, the hospital worker appears to start crying as another man in the same scrubs approached the melee to see what was going on.</p><p>The young man again claimed to the woman the bike was on his account and asked her to move before she rented another bike on the advice of her colleague.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">NYC Health + Hospitals called the video “disturbing” when announcing she was placed on leave Tuesday. The hospital system said she would remain on leave pending a review of the incident. <span class=credit>Twitter/@Imposter_Edits</span></figure><p>Some social media users called the interaction racist while others compared the situation to when Amy Cooper <a href=#>called the police on a black birdwatcher in 2020</a> and lost her job over it.</p><p>The NYPD said it did not receive any 911 calls over this incident.&nbsp;</p><p>Marino said his client is a dedicated hospital worker who has treated “literally thousands of New York City residents of all backgrounds/ethnicities.”</p><p>“Simply, her entire life has been focused on helping others, irrespective of their background,” Marino said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Halfway through the clip, the hospital worker appears to start crying as another man in the same scrubs approached the melee to see what was going on. <span class=credit>Twitter/@Imposter_Edits</span></figure><p>NYC Health + Hospitals called the video “disturbing” when announcing she was placed on leave Tuesday.

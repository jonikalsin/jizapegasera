Fox Valley Park District raised lifeguarding wages to $15 an hour and is giving out $150 referral bonuses for lifeguards.</p><p><b>ALSO SEE: New documentary teaches rip current safety, survival</b></p><p>Both districts said, regardless of age, if you can pass the physical requirements, they want you in the perch.</p><p>“Our oldest lifeguard right now is 60 years old, so it’s not just the young adults that we’re looking to hire,” Ramos said.</p><p>“We have people well into their 50s with plenty of swimming ability and we’d love to have you come join us,” said Andy Walsh, Chicago Park District manager of beaches and pools.</p><p>Naperville’s Centennial Beach opens Saturdayat 11 a.m. as well. Their park district, too, is offering bonuses of $100 if you sign on to be a lifeguard.</p><p>Copyright © 2022 WLS-TV.

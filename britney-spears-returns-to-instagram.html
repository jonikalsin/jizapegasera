YES … sitting pretty is my philosophy !!!! Might be doing this for a VERY VERY LONG TIME … so if you don’t like it don’t f****** follow me and don’t forget KISS IT (sic)”</p><p>The ‘…Baby One More Time’ hitmaker – who was freed from a conservatorship governed by her family and regained control of her fortune and assets back in November 2021 – seemed to be enjoying her new found freedom by posting a slew of racy pictures on the photo-sharing site, but her last post before she took a break was about how she wants to be “feared, not loved.”</p><p>She wrote: “People do love you!” Huh? Huh? I don’t want to be loved. I want to be feared! Being loved and being nice got me taken advantage of so take [your] pity and go f*** yourselves!” (sic)</p><p>The ‘Lucky’ singer – who has been engaged to fitness trainer Sam Asghari since September 2021 – also used her post on the app to discuss her gruelling four-year ‘Piece of Me’ residency in Las Vegas as she returned to the city for the first time as a tourist.</p><p>She wrote: “The only thing I’ve known when I used to go to Vegas was a hour long meet and greets with 40 people every night getting the worst pics of me and then a two hour show! Let’s just say this time visiting it gave me a whole new perspective on what it means to live! Being able to go to the spa was a highlight as well and you know what? Don’t ever pity me like my masseuse does.

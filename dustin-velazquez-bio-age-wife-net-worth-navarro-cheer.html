Well, now, it seems </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Navarro Bulldogs</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> has a new assistant coach, Dustin Velazquez.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, who is he? Keep reading this Dustin Velazquez Bio to learn all about him.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Meet Dustin Velazquez, Navarro Cheer Assistant Coach</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dustin Velazquez joined </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Navarro Bulldogs</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> as its assistant coach in 2022. After summing up his first season onboard, head coach Monica took it to her IG on April 12, 2022, to write, “What a joy it has been to coach alongside you. Your laid-back style is the perfect balance to my over-the-top personality. Your talent is top-notch and your leadership is such a blessing.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, Dustin also shared a few kind words about Monica over his IG on the same day. “I was a young man in search of a purpose and in search of guidance and direction. Monica Aldama single-handedly changed my life,” a line wrote.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It seems that Dustin’s history with Monica goes all the way back to 2015. At the time, Dustin was an athlete at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Navarro</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. According to Monica, she always knew “he had a special heart and that (he) would do big things.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And now, the two are doing those “big things” together.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Furthermore, Dustin’s relationship with Monica isn’t only that of a mentor and apprentice. “Everything she taught me in cheer transferred into my jobs, my relationships, and my marriage. She helped develop me into the person I am,” Dustin explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for those of you wondering, what happened to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Navarro</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>’s former assistant coaches. Andy Cosferent and Kailee Peppers didn’t seem to be involved with </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Navarro Cheer</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> during the 2021-2022 season. So, perhaps, they might have left the show.</span></p><h3><b>Dustin Velazquez Career</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dustin Velazquez initially started his career as a staff instructor at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Universal Cheerleaders Association</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in April 2014.

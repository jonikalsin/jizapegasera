It wasn’t exactly the kind of storytelling that made for interesting characters, so Aeschylus expanded casts to include more characters that could interact with one another.</p><p>He also wrote rather prolifically about the events of the time, such as the Greco-Persian Wars.

Members were sworn under the penalty of death not to release any information about the cult’s rites or practices, which are still mysterious to this day.</p><p>However, some believe that Aeschylus did reveal some of the cult’s secrets in his later plays, allegedly causing the members to make attempts on his life. However, according to the accounts we have today, these attempts are not what ultimately brought him down.</p><p>Instead, a prophecy was reportedly revealed to him that he would die by way of a falling object.

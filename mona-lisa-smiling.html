According to <a href=#>Smithsonian Magazine</a>, the first study presented eight different versions of the Mona Lisa to viewers, with the face slightly altered to be happier or sadder in each.</p><p>These paintings — the eight variations plus the original — were then randomized and presented to viewers roughly 30 times. Study participants then reported whether they believed that Mona Lisa was smiling or frowning in each version.</p><p>“We were very surprised to find out that the original ‘Mona Lisa’ is almost always seen as being happy,” Jürgen Kornmeier, lead author of the study, said in a <a href=#>news release</a>. “That calls the common opinion among art historians into question.”</p><p>The study participants placed the real version of the Mona Lisa in the “happy/smiling” category 100 percent of the time, according to Smithsonian Magazine.</p><p>The second experiment repeated the same methodology, but this time only the real Mona Lisa was smiling — all the other versions were made to depict shades of sadness. This study found that in the presence of the sadder images, participants perceived Mona Lisa to be more somber.</p><p>“The data show that our perception, for instance of whether something is sad or happy, is not absolute but adapts to the environment with astonishing speed,” Kornmeier said.</p><p>Still, the real Mona Lisa is said to have led a happy life, all things considered.</p><p>Mona Lisa, or Lisa Gherardini, was the wife of a Florentine cloth merchant. The pair apparently lived together until Mona Lisa’s husband passed away, leaving her to take care of the children with the help of his fortune.</p><p>Next, check out the <a href=#>secrets behind Mona Lisa’s smile</a>, before finding out about <a href=#>Leonardo da Vinci’s ingenious inventions that changed history forever</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuu82aZKWho5Z6tLnIpaCnnw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

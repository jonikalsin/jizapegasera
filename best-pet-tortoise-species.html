And just by watching them move around and interact with their habitat can help relieve stress. They also teach patience to adults and kids both as they learn to care for these incredible animals.</p><p>If you’re thinking of welcoming a tortoise into your home, there are a number of different species available on the market to take home as pets. But some are more suitable for a human home life than others – so how do you know which ones are right for you and your lifestyle? We did some digging and put together a list of the 7 best types of tortoises to keep as pets to help you choose the right reptile for you.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64></p><h2><span id=The_7_Types_of_Tortoises_that_Make_Great_Pets>The 7 Types of Tortoises that Make Great Pets</span></h2><h3 class=num-head><span id=1_Egyptian_Tortoise><span class=dhn>1.</span> Egyptian Tortoise</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>In nature, the Egyptian Tortoise can be found wandering the lands of Egypt, Libya, and even some parts of Israel. But they are also popular family pets. They are endangered in the wild, however, so pet Egyptian Tortoises should only be purchased through dealers who are authorized to sell them. These are extremely small tortoises that need only about 4 square feet of space to dwell in, making them an excellent pet option for apartment lifestyles.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=2_Marginated_Tortoise><span class=dhn>2.</span> Marginated Tortoise</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The Marginated Tortoise can grow to be up to 14 inches long, making them one of the largest common pet tortoises in existence. They are originally from Greece and love to dig in sand and dirt. They prefer to live outside in warmer climates where they have plenty of room to roam, dig, and swim. If kept indoors, they should be provided with an enclosed shelter of at least 16 square feet to ensure that they don’t become bored or depressed.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=3_Pancake_Tortoise><span class=dhn>3.</span> Pancake Tortoise</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Unlike most tortoises, which have high, rounded shells, the Pancake Tortoise has a flat shell that looks like a sea turtle’s shell. The shape of their shells doesn’t protect them well, so they naturally move faster than most other tortoises, making them a fun pet to play around within their shelter or in the yard on a warm summer day. These turtles are easy to take care of, and like most tortoises, they love getting leafy greens at snack time.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=4_Leopard_Tortoise><span class=dhn>4.</span> Leopard Tortoise</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>These big creatures can weigh up to a whopping 40 pounds, making them one of the largest tortoise species in the world. They’re too big to live inside, so they should be kept in a secure enclosure outdoors, but owners should beware that they need a large space to live in — at least the size of a bedroom within a house. These tortoises don’t dig and are pretty docile, and they are easy to take care of, which makes them <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal>ideal for first-time pet owners</a>.</p><h3 class=num-head></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>These tortoises can be found living wild in the Caribbean islands and South America. These are medium-sized tortoises that don’t grow any bigger than about 14 inches in length. These curious tortoises aren’t timid and enjoy the company of their human family members for the most part. One unique aspect of the <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Red-Footed Tortoise</a> is that in addition to leafy greens and vegetables, they enjoy chowing down on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal>bugs and insects</a>.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=6_Hermanns_Tortoise><span class=dhn>6.</span> Hermann’s Tortoise</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>These tiny turtles only measure in at about 8 inches long. The ends of their tails grow something that looks like a claw, and they need a space to live in that mimics their natural Mediterranean environment, with the inclusion of a basking spotlight and a sandy environment. These are high-energy tortoises that will climb the walls of their enclosure, so they should be kept in a completely enclosed shelter. They are gentle and don’t mind being handled occasionally.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=7_Indian_Star_Tortoise><span class=dhn>7.</span> Indian Star Tortoise</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Found in nature in both Sri Lanka and India, the <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Indian Star Tortoise</a> has an interesting pattern on their shell that looks like stars. Their native landscapes are threatened, so they can’t legally be exported for sale. The Asian Turtle Conservation Network has been working to save these and other turtles in the continent. Therefore, they aren’t readily available, and their scarcity makes them an expensive family pet to consider investing in. These tortoises are social and would love to live with a friend within the same shelter space, but in line with the Asian Turtle Conservation Network’s values, we recommend these tortoises live in conservation spaces.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64></p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>The 7 best pet tortoises on our list are all awesome to have as pets if you provide the right habitat an care.

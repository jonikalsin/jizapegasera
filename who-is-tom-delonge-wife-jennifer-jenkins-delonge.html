He is a co-founder of the rock group Blink-182 and has served as the guitarist and co-lead vocalist during three separate runs: from 1992 to 2005, from 2009 to 2015, and starting in 2022. He has a distinctive nasal singing voice. Along with being the lead singer and guitarist for the rock group Angels & Airwaves, he left Blink-182 for the first time in 2005, leading him to form the group.</p><h2>Who is Tom DeLonge’s wife Jennifer Jenkins DeLonge?</h2><p>Jennifer Jenkins was married to Tom DeLonge, best known as the guitarist and co-vocalist of the musical group Blink-182, for 18 years. On May 26, 2001, they married on Coronado Island in San Diego Bay. They have two children, Ava Elizabeth (born in 2002) and Jonas Rocket (born in 2006).</p><p>DeLonge grew up in the Poway, California, suburbs, where he discovered skateboarding at a young age. When DeLonge got his first guitar, he started writing punk rock songs. During his high school years, he formed Blink-182 with bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor. In the mid-1990s, the band gained a following through independent releases and relentless touring, particularly in their home country and Australia. In 1996, they signed with MCA Records, and their second album, Dude Ranch (1997), included the hit single “Dammit.”</p><p>Enema of the State (1999), which featured three hit singles and went quadruple-platinum in the United States, sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Take Off Your Pants and Jacket by Blink-182 was the band’s first number-one album. DeLonge experimented with post-hardcore music on Box Car Racer, which grew into a full-fledged band in 2002 but disbanded the following year. Blink-182’s untitled fifth studio album (2003) reflected a shift in tone within the band, which disbanded in 2005 due to internal strife spearheaded by DeLonge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqyfonqlscuopaCdXay2p7GMo5ynppmbsrN5yZ6lpKGeqHqlscuopaCdXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

It isn't reasonable to vote that way for anyone, simply because we're not far enough into the game for their activity to be known yet.<p>Also, so what if someone came online and then went off during that period? I don't check threads I've posted in that often unless I get a notification about them, and these forums have a glitchy notification system. It wouldn't be the first time someone wasn't posting in a Mafia game simply because they didn't get the notification and didn't think to check the forum. The same thing cropped up in the YOU Mafia.</p><p>And I don't care who it is.

That it appeared to have been done when we're not even fully through Day 1 is what made me suspicious.</p><p>As for what I mean about my argument defending you: Think about it.</p><p>We're getting into godfather accusations just because I'm willing to be investigated in every aspect? I'm willing to use <i>my own death</i> to prove you wrong.

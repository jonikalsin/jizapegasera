I wish Molly the best,” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Matthew Perry</strong></a> revealed in a 2021 statement (obtained by PEOPLE), announcing the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>end of his relationship</a> and engagement with <strong>Molly Hurwitz</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While fans know the late comedian thanks to his portrayal of one of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TV’s most famous characters</a>, Molly leads a much more private life. Although she also works in the entertainment industry, Molly’s Instagram page is private.</p><h2>Molly Hurwitz Was Engaged to Matthew Perry For 6 Months</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Matthew <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced his engagement</a> to Molly on Thanksgiving day in November of 2020, and was ecstatic at the time. “I decided to get engaged. Luckily, I happened to be dating the greatest woman on the face of the planet at this time,” the&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;star told&nbsp;PEOPLE. He had been dating Molly for about two years by then; their romance reportedly began in 2018, according to the outlet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Molly reportedly confirmed the romance in a Christmas tree-themed Instagram post during the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>holiday season</a> in 2019; the photo was said to have been taken inside Matthew’s $35 million penthouse in Century City, CA.&nbsp;“According to my parents’ custody agreement, my mother was not allowed to have a Christmas tree. Fortunately, there’s no such agreement for a daughter’s boyfriend, so Hurwitz gets a treeeeeeee!!!,” she captioned the post, sources told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>.</p><h2>Molly Hurwitz Has a 22-Year Age Gap With Matthew Perry</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Molly was born on July 13, 1991, according to multiple outlets. This makes her 22 years younger than Matthew, who was born in 1969.</p><h2>Molly Hurwitz Is a Literary Manager</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Molly was working for Zero Gravity Management in Los Angeles, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn </a>page. The company has some pretty impressive clients, including <strong>Maggie Grace</strong>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Katherine Heigl</strong></a> and <strong>Angela Lansbury</strong>. She now works for Thruline Entertainment as a lit manager.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Molly was also featured in a YouTube series called Girl Stories. In the just under four-minute comedic clip, which can be seen below, she plays the role of a girl named Abbi and talks about being Jewish in New York and beyond. The description for the video reads, “Abbi’s repurposing of her Judaism goes badly” and was released in 2017.</p><h2>Molly Hurwitz Was Previously Romantically Linked to B.J. Novak</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Since Molly is often around celebrities when working as an agent, it’s not too surprising that she would have more than one famous boyfriend. She reportedly dated<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Office</a> star before she dated Matthew.</p><h2>Molly Hurwitz & Matthew Perry Were Not Pictured Together Until 2019</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Although they had reportedly been dating since 2018, Matthew and Molly were not spotted together in public until they went on a dinner date at Dan Tana’s Italian restaurant in West Hollywood, CA in late 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K6sLjLsmShraKstrXGjKaYrayYmsRuvMSrqbJllp6ur6%2FEnmRtamdqgnSEjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
